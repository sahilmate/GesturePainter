# GesturePainter

GesturePainter is a hand tracking paint application that allows you to draw on a virtual canvas using your hand gestures. It uses OpenCV for video capture, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and Pygame for rendering the drawing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of Python.
* You have a Windows/Linux/Mac machine.
* You have installed the OpenCV, MediaPipe, Pygame, and NumPy libraries. You can install these using pip:
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pygame numpy
## Using GesturePainter

To use GesturePainter, follow these steps:

1. Run the script in your Python environment:
python GesturePainter.py

2. Position your hand in front of the webcam. The application will track the position of your index finger.

3. To start drawing, bring your index finger and middle finger close together. The application will draw a line following the movement of your index finger.

4. To stop drawing, separate your index finger and middle finger.

5. To exit the application, press the 'x' key on your keyboard or close the Pygame window.
