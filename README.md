# GesturePainter

GesturePainter is an innovative hand tracking paint application that empowers you to create digital masterpieces using intuitive hand gestures. Leveraging OpenCV for video capture, MediaPipe for precise hand tracking, and Pygame for rendering, GesturePainter offers a unique and engaging drawing experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- **Python:** Ensure you have the latest version of Python installed.
- **Operating System:** GesturePainter is compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac.
- **Libraries:** Install the necessary libraries using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python mediapipe pygame numpy
  ```

## Using GesturePainter

To unleash your creativity with GesturePainter, follow these simple steps:

1. Run the script in your Python environment:
   ```bash
   python GesturePainter.py
   ```

2. **Hand Tracking:**
   Position your hand in front of the webcam, and the application will adeptly track the movement of your index finger.

3. **Start Drawing:**
   Bring your index finger and middle finger close together to initiate drawing. GesturePainter responds by creating a line that follows the graceful movement of your index finger.

4. **Stop Drawing:**
   Simply separate your index finger and middle finger to halt the drawing process.

5. **Exit the Application:**
   Press the 'x' key on your keyboard or close the Pygame window to gracefully exit GesturePainter.
